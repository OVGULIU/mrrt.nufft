pyir.nufft was developed by Gregory R. Lee. It is in large part a translation
of the Matlab-based NUFFT implementation found in the Michigan Image
Reconstruction Toolbox created by Jeff Fessler and his students. The original
Matlab toolbox is available from http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/.

    It would also be courteous for you to cite the toolbox and any related

    yet, email me the changes and I'll consider incorporating them into the
    toolbox.
